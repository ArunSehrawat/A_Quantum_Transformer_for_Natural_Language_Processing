# Quantum Transformers for Natural Language Processing


This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks exploring **Quantum Transformer (QT)** architectures by replacing classical linear layers with learnable quantum unitaries and simulating them in PyTorch.


### 1. Interferometric Transformer (IT)  
Replaces classical linear layers with **interferometric networks**—phase shifters + beamsplitters (Fourier transforms).  


### 2. Rotational Transformer (RT)  
Replaces classical linear layers with **qubit‐rotation networks**—only single‐qubit Ry rotations.
